> Background Elimination

     - Find white lines using adaptive mean threshholding
     - L_AND the filled block-targeted Canny and the blue filter
     - Improve vision reliability in poor lighting conditions ( Shallow angle of lighting )

> Rectangle Discovery

     - Re-add canny-contour testing for the rect detection
     - Add dilation to the filled contours produced by drawSquares()
     - Add snap-to-line for blocks 
     - Try doing detection w/ distance varied discrimination  over sections of the image
     - Add blue-over-line-interruption for block decisions


> Post Processing

     X- Add out-of-course removal
     - Add off-line removal
     - Improve fault detection and response capabilities in vision
        - If < 3 blocks detected:
             - Try other methods
             X- Rotate
             - Drive to position 1 and search again
                -> Drive to position 2, search again
             + More fault tolerance is overkill

        - If > 3 blocks detected:
            - FUCK!
            - Try other methods
            - Rotate?
            - Increase rectangle discrimination ( ? Might not help ? )
            - Tighten color discrimination
